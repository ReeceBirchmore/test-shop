# Getting Started

This app has a few dependencies, ensure you run NPM install in the root of the app


This is unfinished! There is no homepage/product list page as time didn't really allow for that.

In order to test how I have completed 3/5 tasks, head to the localdomain /product/:id, with :id being any number between 1 and 20 (as per fakestoreapi docs) e.g. http://localhost:3000/product/20 and add the item to your cart, you can then click the cart icon on the top right to open the cart. Refreshing the page will remove the cart data.
